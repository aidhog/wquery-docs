title: Run experiments in Virtuoso
---

The SPARQL benchmarks use a configuration file containing the
parameters that are necessary to run each experiment. The procedures
to run experiments in Virtuoso and Blazegraph are the same. Thus, the
following commands show how experiments are runned in both engines.

```
$ cd $WD_HOME
$ bin/run_quins_benchmark config/virtuoso.rb
$ bin/run_quins_benchmark config/blazegraph.rb
$ bin/run_paths_benchmark config/paths_virtuoso.rb
$ bin/run_paths_benchmark config/paths_blazegraph.rb
```

After running these scripts, a CSV file is created for each set of queries.
In the case of quins, each query file contains a bitmask key that indicates
what quin components are variables (0) and what are considered constant (1).
For example, the file `results_blazegraph_onaryrel_01110.csv` correspond
to the results obtained for the bitmask key 01110 using the Blazegraph engine.

Results for the quin benchmark are published in the folder `results/quins` of
the repository. Similarly, the results for the experiments with snowflake
structure are published in the folder `results/paths`.
