title: Run experiments in Neo4j
---

The Neo4j benchmarks are executed with the following commands:

```
$ cd $WD_HOME/neo4j-experiment-scripts/quins
$ execute_quin_queries.sh
$ cd $WD_HOME/neo4j-experiment-scripts/paths
$ path1.sh
$ path2.sh
```

These commands assume that the database files are in the folders
`$DB_1` and `$DB_2`. Both folders have exactly the same data. We
alternate the databases to avoid caching effects produced by the
caching policies of the operative system.
