All experiments will be run by a user identified as `$USER` which
home is `$USER_HOME`. Also, `$USER` is in the `sudo` group.

The code is tracked in
[a git repository](https://bitbucket.org/danielhz/wikidata-experiments).
You can get the code with the following command:

```
git clone https://bitbucket.org/danielhz/wikidata-experiments.git
```

In that follows we call the folder created by `git` as `$WD_HOME`.
