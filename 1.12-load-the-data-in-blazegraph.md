title: Load the data in Blazegraph
---

Blazegraph provides several backend formats. In these experiments we
use triple stores and quad stores. The first suffices for the schemas
`naryrel`, `sgprop` and `stdreif`. The second is required for the
`ngraphs` schema.

The configuration for each backend is in the files
`$WD_HOME/dbfiles/blazegraph/triples.properties` and
`$WD_HOME/dbfiles/blazegraph/quads.properties`, respectively.
