title: Download the dataset
---

You can download the dataset with the following command:

```
wget https://dx.doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.3208498.v1
```

In that follows we call the file created by `wget` as `$DATASET`.

*Note:* This task takes a while, so you can continue with the next tasks in
parallel.
