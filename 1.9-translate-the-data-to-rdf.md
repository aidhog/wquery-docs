title: Translating the data to RDF
---

Before translating the data to the RDF model we need to split the data into
several smaller files. Thus, translating every small file is done by an
independent process. The translating process leaks memory so splitting it
ensure that the process ends without getting an out memory.

The commands below prepare the dataset. We assume that `$DATASET` is
the path to the dataset, `$RDF` is the folder where we store
the RDF versions of the dataset and `$WD_HOME` is the folder of the
code.

```
cd $RDF
bunzip2 -c $DATASET | split -d -a 3 -C 100000000
rename '/$/.json/' x*
gzip x*.json
cd $WD_HOME
translation/translate_all.rb $RDF
```

After the commands above the `$RDF` folder will contain several JSON
files (e.g., `x000.json.gz`, `x001.json.gz`). For each of this JSON
files four NQUADS files are created, one for each schema. They are
named using the keywords `naryrel`, `ngraphs`, `sgprop` and `stdreif`
are created. For example, the file `x000.json.gz` is translated into
the files `x000-naryrel.nq.gz`, `x000-ngraphs.nq.gz`,
`x000-sgprop.nq.gz` and `x000-stdreif.nq.gz`.
