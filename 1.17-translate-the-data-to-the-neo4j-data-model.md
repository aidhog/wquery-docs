title: Translate the data to the Neo4j Data model
---

These scripts assume the existence of the following environment
variables:

* `$WD_HOME` (where the repository was cloned).
* `$DATASET` (the path of the compressed json file).
* `$DATASET_UNCOMPRESSED` (the path of the uncompressed dataset).
* `$LANG_LABELS` (the folder to store labels).
* `$LANG_DESCRIPTIONS` (the folder to store descriptions).
* `$LANG_ALIASES` (the folder to store aliases).
* `$MODEL_LIGHT` (the folder to store the light model).
* `$MODEL_COMPLETE` (the folder to store the complete model).

Then, the following commands create the language files and translate
the data to CSV files to be imported into Neo4j.

```
bunzip2 -c $DATASET > $DATASET_UNCOMPRESSED
cd $WD_HOME/neo4j-experiment-scripts/generate_csv
python lang-generator.py        # Genarate language files.
python parser.py                # Generate the complete model.
python parser-light.py          # Generate the model without language labels.
```
