The quins file must be in the same file than the script that execute the
quins benchmark. For example, the experiment for the bitmask `10000` is
executed with the commands:

```
cd $WD_HOME/postgresql-experiment-scripts/run-queries
ln -s $WD_HOME/query_parameters/quins/quins_10000 quins.csv
ruby script_f.rb
rm quins.csv
```

Similarly, snowflake benchmarks are executed with the commands:

```
cd $WD_HOME/postgresql-experiment-scripts/run-queries
ln -s $WD_HOME/query_parameters/paths/path_1.json path_1.json
ruby path1_production.rb
rm path_1.json
ln -s $WD_HOME/query_parameters/paths/path_2.json path_2.json
ruby path2_production.rb
rm path_2.json
```
