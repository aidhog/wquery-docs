# About

This documentation aims to make repeatable the experiments described in the
paper
*Querying Wikidata: Comparing SPARQL, Relational and Graph Databases*

## Related resources

To repeat this experiment it is necessary to download and install the
database engines and the following resources:

**Code and results (<https://bitbucket.org/danielhz/wikidata-experiments>).**
The code required to repeat these experiments is published on this repository.
Also, parameters to generate queris and results of experiments are published
in this repository.

**Dataset (<https://dx.doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.3208498.v1>).**
All experiments are done using the dump of Wikidata published on
January 04, 2017. The original dump was downloaded from the
[dumps folder](https://dumps.wikimedia.org/other/wikidata/) published by
the Wikimedia Foundation. However, the contents in this folder are frequently
updated and old dumps are discarded. Thus, to make this experiment repeatable
we published the dump used on Figshare.
